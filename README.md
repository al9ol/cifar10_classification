# cifar10_classification
In this repository, I've been posting my project for an image classification task. The backend is the tensorflow.
I try to implement different neural network architectures and fine-tune them.
The dataset readers (the folder 'dataset') were copypasted from the Stanford CS231n class dedicated convolutional neural network.
